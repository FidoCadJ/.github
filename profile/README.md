# FidoCadJ

## Introduction

FidoCadJ is an easy to use 2D vector drawing program, with a vast library of electrical symbols and footprints.
Its drawings can be exported in several graphic formats (PDF, EPS, PGF for LaTeX, SVG, PNG, JPG). 
FidoCadJ can be useful as a basic schematic capture for rapidly obtaining a drawing that can be put in a presentation or in a paper.
FidoCadJ employs a file format containing text, very compact and perfect for copying and pasting from/into newsgroups and forum messages.
